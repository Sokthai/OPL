;; What does the "recursive" mean?
;; 
;; For each of the five statements, uncomment the definition line to indicate
;; whether the statement is true or false.
;;
;; 1. Recursive means defined in terms of itself.
;; (define r1 #t)
;; (define r1 #f)
;;
;; 2. Recursion in computing is analogous to induction in mathematics.
;; (define r2 #t)
;; (define r2 #f)
;;
;; 3. If a process can be defined using an iterative recursion,
;;    it's always better to do it that way.
;; (define r3 #t)
;; (define r3 #f)
;;
;; 4. Recursive and looping are synonyms.
;; (define r4 #t)
;; (define r4 #f)
;;
;; 5. Iteration and looping are synonyms.
;; (define r5 #t)
;; (define r5 #f)

;; autograding note: this question is graded as all-or-nothing;
;; unless you have all of the answers correct, you will not receive credit.

;; What does "tail recursion" mean?
;; 
;; For each of the five statements, uncomment the definition line to indicate
;; whether the statement is true or false.
;;
;; 1. All recursive programs are tail-recursive.
;; (define tr1 #t)
;; (define tr1 #f)
;;
;; 2. Tail recursion is a feature implemented by the Scheme interpreter (or compiler).
;; (define tr2 #t)
;; (define tr2 #f)
;;
;; 3. In order to be considered a proper Scheme implementation, tail recursion must
;;    be provided.
;; (define tr3 #t)
;; (define tr3 #f)
;;
;; 4. If a program can be optimized with tail recursion, when carried out, it is
;;    effectively performing a loop.
;; (define tr4 #t)
;; (define tr4 #f)
;;
;; 5. In Racket, a non-tail-recursive procedure will exhaust memory at
;;    approximately the same depth as a C-style language would overflow the stack.
;; (define tr5 #t)
;; (define tr5 #f)
