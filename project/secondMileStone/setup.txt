;How to run the program:
> (search "boy") ;;search the word "boy" and download the audio to local directory
> (pronounce result) ;;play the audio 

NOTE: since the audio of the word is downloaded each time it search, it will 
automatically save to the downloads folder, and the path to the download folder
is different from OS to OS, you may need to change if it is not wokring for you.

I have created 3 difference paths for difference OS.
macPath, winPath, and ubuPath. 
I use macPath since i use my Macbook. Change the path to your needs at line 49 and 150. if the 3 paths is not working, you need to provide the audio path where
the audio file downloaded to.
