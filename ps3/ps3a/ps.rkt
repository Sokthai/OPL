;; SICP exercise 1.30 (pp. 60), convert the recursive implementation
;; to iterative.

;; Un-comment and fill in the below procedure
;; "term" is a procedure that transforms parameter "a"
;; "next" is a procedure acts as the successor function

(define (sum term a next b)
   (define (iter a result)
     (if (> a b) result (iter (next a) (+ (term a) result)))
   )
   (iter a 0)
)
 ;; get rid of this line when you comment-in the body stub.


;; Working towards higher-order procedures: Do SICP exercise 1.31 (a)
;; and (b) (pp. 60–61).  fill in the below procedures

;; (a) Recursive product procedure
(define (product1 term a next b) 
  (if (> a b) 1
      (* (term a)
         (product1 term (next a) next b)))

;; factorial procedure in terms of product
(define (factorial n) 
  (product1 identity 1 inc n)
) 

;; Approximations to pi using john wallis' formula
;(define (pi-term n) 
;  (cond
;    [(< n 1) 1]
;    [(even? n) ]
;)

;; e.g.,
;; (* (product1 pi-term 1 next 6) 4)
;; = 3.3436734693877552 or 3 421/1225


;; (b) Iterative product procedure
(define (product2 term a next b)
   (define (iter a result)
     (if (> a b) result (iter (next a) (* (term a) result)))
   )
   (iter a 1)

;; SICP exercise 1.32 (a only): Implement accumulate and show how sum
;; and product can be defined with calls to accumulate. Specify
;; whether you have built the iterative or recursive version.  fill in
;; the below procedures

;; (a) Recursive process
(define (accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)
  1)

(define (sum1 term a next b)
  1)

(define (product term a next b)
  1)

;; SICP exercise 1.41 (pp. 77): Procedures that return procedures.

;;  ((double inc) 3) is 5

(define (double f) 
  (lambda (z)  (f (f z))))

;; SICP exercise 1.42 (pp. 77): More procedures that return procedures.
;; e.g.,
;;  ((compose inc square) 6) is 37
;;  ((compose square inc) 6) is 49
;;  ((compose (compose square square) square) 2) is 256
;;  ((compose square (compose square square)) 2) is also 256
(define (compose f g)

;; Here is an implementation of expnt, a procedure that generates
;; a procedure for raising its input to its argument.
;;
;;     E.g., (expnt 2) generates a procedure for squaring a
;;     number. The provided implementation of expnt generates a
;;     recursive process. Re-implement it as an iterative process
;;     (probably using a helper procedure).
;;
;; generates a procedure that raises its argument to the nth power
;; Recursive process
;; e.g. ((expnt 0) 10) is 1     (10^0)
;;      ((expnt 1) 10) is 10    (10^1)
;;      ((expnt 2) 10) is 100   (10^2)
;;      ((expnt 3) 10) is 1000  (10^3)

          (lambda (x) (* x ((expnt (- n 1)) x)))
