;; SICP exercise 1.30 (pp. 60), convert the recursive implementation

;; Un-comment and fill in the below procedure
;; "term" is a procedure that transforms parameter "a"
;; "next" is a procedure acts as the successor function

(define (sum term a next b)

;; Working towards higher-order procedures: Do SICP exercise 1.31 (a)
;; and (b) (pp. 60â€“61).  fill in the below procedures

;; (a) Recursive product procedure
(define (product1 term a next b) 
  1) 

;; factorial procedure in terms of product
(define (factorial n) 
  1) 

;; Approximations to pi using john wallis' formula
(define (pi-term n) 
  1)

;; e.g.,
;; (* (product1 pi-term 1 next 6) 4)
;; = 3.3436734693877552 or 3 421/1225


;; (b) Iterative product procedure
(define (product2 term a next b)
  1)

;; SICP exercise 1.32 (a only): Implement accumulate and show how sum
;; and product can be defined with calls to accumulate. Specify
;; whether you have built the iterative or recursive version.  fill in
;; the below procedures

;; (a) Recursive process
(define (accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)
  1)

(define (sum1 term a next b)
  1)

(define (product term a next b)
  1)

;; (b) Iterative process
(define (accumulate1 combiner null-value term a next b)
  1)

;; SICP exercise 1.41 (pp. 77): Procedures that return procedures.
;; e.g.
;;  ((double inc) 3) is 5
;;  (((double double) inc) 3) is 7
;;  (((double (double double)) inc) 5) is 21
(define (double f) 
  (lambda (z) z))

;; SICP exercise 1.42 (pp. 77): More procedures that return procedures.
;; e.g.,
;;  ((compose inc square) 6) is 37
;;  ((compose square inc) 6) is 49
;;  ((compose (compose square square) square) 2) is 256
;;  ((compose square (compose square square)) 2) is also 256
(define (compose f g) 
  (lambda (z) z))

;; Here is an implementation of expnt, a procedure that generates
;; a procedure for raising its input to its argument.
;;
;;     E.g., (expnt 2) generates a procedure for squaring a
;;     number. The provided implementation of expnt generates a
;;     recursive process. Re-implement it as an iterative process
;;     (probably using a helper procedure).
;;
;; generates a procedure that raises its argument to the nth power
;; Recursive process
;; e.g. ((expnt 0) 10) is 1     (10^0)
;;      ((expnt 1) 10) is 10    (10^1)
;;      ((expnt 2) 10) is 100   (10^2)
;;      ((expnt 3) 10) is 1000  (10^3)
(define (expnt n)
  (if (= n 0) (lambda (x) 1)
      (if (= n 1)
          (lambda (x) x)
          (lambda (x) (* x ((expnt (- n 1)) x))))))

;Iterative process 
(define (expnt-iter n)
  (lambda (n) n))
